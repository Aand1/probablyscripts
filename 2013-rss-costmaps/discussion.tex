\subsection{Future Work}
There are numerous possible continuations of this work. To start, measuring the closest point on the path to the obstacle (i.e. $\yhat$) is not the only measure of the quality of a path. Path length has a direct impact on the efficiency of the robot and the person. The other metric of the quality of a path that we are considering investigating is the \emph{average} distance from the path to the obstacle. The two paths in Figure \ref{fig:bracket} are roughly equivalent in their closest path distance, but the average distance is much different. Whether that is good or not is not even determined yet for many scenarios. 

There is also room to explore the many assumptions our setup used, such as the cell connectivity (8 vs. 4) and the alignment of the start and end points with the grid axes. There are further practical issues in terms of implementing the non-lethal obstacles, such as the limited precision of the grid values. We assumed that numbers could be arbitrarily small, when in reality, at least in the ROS example, the grid values are actually stored as \texttt{unsigned char}s. What effect does the discretization of the cost values have? 

There are also many other functions besides Gaussians that could fit into this framework, such as $f(x,y) = A/(k(x^2) + k(y^2) + 1$, which has the same rough shape as a Gaussian. However, finding the correct function that models the exact behavior desired is also yet unsolved. The easiest (and possibly hackiest) way to get a desired behavior might be to create a piecemeal function to ensure that the desired passing distance is achieved.
